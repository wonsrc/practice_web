        <strong>Bob Sweeney</strong>: There was a moment, 
        when I used to blame everything and everyone for all the pain and 
        suffering and vile things that happened to me, 
        that I saw happen to my people. Used to blame everybody. 
        Blamed white people, blamed society, blamed God. 
        I didn't get no answers 'cause I was asking the wrong questions. 
        You have to ask the right questions.<br>
