    “I just want to keep working hard, stay humble, 
    and keep trying to win games.” 
    “If you want to look good in front of thousands, 
    you have to out work thousands in front of nobody.” 
    “If your dreams don't match your actions, 
    you can either change your dreams or change your actions.”<br>

    <strong>Bob Sweeney</strong>: There was a moment, 
    when I used to blame everything and everyone for all the pain and 
    suffering and vile things that happened to me, 
    that I saw happen to my people. Used to blame everybody. 
    Blamed white people, blamed society, blamed God. 
    I didn't get no answers 'cause I was asking the wrong questions. 
    You have to ask the right questions.<br>
